    * Last Purchase Price - This field displays the most recent purchase price of the item as determined by purchase order receipt transactions. 
    * Purchase Price - Price entered that you pay for this item. If you do not enter a price, then the most recent purchase price from purchase orders provides the price for this item by default.

The estimated Gross Profit for Items on a transaction provides the data needed to calculate the total estimated Gross Profit on that transaction.

The following Cost Estimate Types on Items are available:

    * Average Cost - NetSuite calculates an average cost of the units purchased. 
    * Last Purchase Price - This field displays the most recent purchase price of the item as determined by purchase order receipt transactions. 
    * Purchase Price - Price entered that you pay for this item. If you do not enter a price, then the most recent purchase price from purchase orders provides the price for this item by default.

          o Next priority would be to use the purchase price.

The estimated Gross Profit for Items on a transaction provides the data needed to calculate the total estimated Gross Profit on that transaction.

The following Cost Estimate Types on Items are available:
    * Item Defined Cost - a user-defined amount, entered into the Item Defined Cost field on the Item definition page.
    * Average Cost - NetSuite calculates an average cost of the units purchased. 
    * Last Purchase Price - This field displays the most recent purchase price of the item as determined by purchase order receipt transactions. 
    * Purchase Price - Price entered that you pay for this item. If you do not enter a price, then the most recent purchase price from purchase orders provides the price for this item by default.
    * Preferred Vendor Rate - This option is only used if the Multi-Vendor feature is enabled and multiple vendors supply the same item.
          o First priority is to use the preferred vendor rate if defined on the Item record.
          o Next priority would be to use the purchase price.
          o Last priority would be the purchase order rate. (Initially this uses the preferred vendor rate cost, and then after a purchase order is entered, this type uses the most recent actual purchase order rate. Special orders and drop-shipped items use this cost information.)
    * Derived from member items - Total costs of items currently included in a kit. This Cost Estimate Type only applies to kits and sums the estimated costs of each item in the kit, based on each of their individual Cost Estimate Types. Uses the latest definition of the kit, not its historical definition."

The estimated Gross Profit for Items on a transaction provides the data needed to calculate the total estimated Gross Profit on that transaction.
The individual line items that you enter in a transaction determine the amounts that post when you process that transaction.
The following Cost Estimate Types on Items are available:
    * Item Defined Cost - a user-defined amount, entered into the Item Defined Cost field on the Item definition page.
    * Average Cost - NetSuite calculates an average cost of the units purchased. 
    * Last Purchase Price - This field displays the most recent purchase price of the item as determined by purchase order receipt transactions. 
    * Purchase Price - Price entered that you pay for this item. If you do not enter a price, then the most recent purchase price from purchase orders provides the price for this item by default.
    * Preferred Vendor Rate - This option is only used if the Multi-Vendor feature is enabled and multiple vendors supply the same item.
          o First priority is to use the preferred vendor rate if defined on the Item record.
          o Next priority would be to use the purchase price.
          o Last priority would be the purchase order rate. (Initially this uses the preferred vendor rate cost, and then after a purchase order is entered, this type uses the most recent actual purchase order rate. Special orders and drop-shipped items use this cost information.)
    * Derived from member items - Total costs of items currently included in a kit. This Cost Estimate Type only applies to kits and sums the estimated costs of each item in the kit, based on each of their individual Cost Estimate Types. Uses the latest definition of the kit, not its historical definition."

This price is determined by the most recent transaction for the item that added positive inventory, such as a purchase receipt, inventory transfer or inventory adjustment. (This does not include item returns or assembly unbuilds.)
If two transactions are entered on the same day, the one entered later takes precedence and is used to calculate the last purchase price.
When you use the Multiple-Location Inventory feature, the following is true:
    * The last purchase price reflects the most recent transaction at any location. 
    * The Inventory subtab of inventory item records includes a link to the last positive-inventory transaction per location.
    * If multiple purchases are made on the same day with different prices and locations, then the highest price paid on that day becomes the last purchase price.

          o If there are multiple receipts for the item against the same purchase order, the calculation is made using the difference between the purchase order and the last receipt (the receipt that fully receives the order).

NetSuite assigns the default priority “Auto” to all new and existing tab, category and item records in your account. The priority is calculated based on the position of the item or category in the hierarchy of your Web site.
For example, your Web site tabs automatically generate a default priority value of 1.0 because they are top level pages. A category published to a tab gets a priority of 0.5. An item published to a category on a tab gets a priority of 0.3."

      For example, rather than creating multiple purchase orders for each instance of demand, you can consolidate into one order created from the demand planning engine for all items required within the next 2 weeks. By sending a consolidated purchase order to a vendor, the vendor can ship all items at one time rather than in multiple shipments, potentially resulting in reduced shipping costs.

The estimated Gross Profit for Items on a transaction provides the data needed to calculate the total estimated Gross Profit on that transaction.

    * Average Cost - NetSuite calculates an average cost of the units purchased. 
    * Last Purchase Price - This field displays the most recent purchase price of the item as determined by purchase order receipt transactions. 
    * Purchase Price - Price entered that you pay for this item. If you do not enter a price, then the most recent purchase price from purchase orders provides the price for this item by default.

          o Last priority would be the purchase order rate. (Initially this uses the preferred vendor rate cost, and then after a purchase order is entered, this type uses the most recent actual purchase order rate. Special orders and drop-shipped items use this cost information.)
    * Derived from member items - Total costs of items currently included in a kit. This Cost Estimate Type only applies to kits and sums the estimated costs of each item in the kit, based on each of their individual Cost Estimate Types.

    * Last Purchase Price - This field displays the most recent purchase price of the item as determined by purchase order receipt transactions. 
    * Purchase Price - Price entered that you pay for this item. If you do not enter a price, then the most recent purchase price from purchase orders provides the price for this item by default.

The estimated Gross Profit for Items on a transaction provides the data needed to calculate the total estimated Gross Profit on that transaction.

    * Last Purchase Price - This field displays the most recent purchase price of the item as determined by purchase order receipt transactions. 
    * Purchase Price - Price entered that you pay for this item. If you do not enter a price, then the most recent purchase price from purchase orders provides the price for this item by default.
